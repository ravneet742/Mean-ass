//Steps to Configuring an Express Application:
//Step 1: Writing the following command in terminal, to create a nodejs application, because our express server will work inside the node application.
Command- npm init

//above command is used for initialization.
// We can use "npm init -y" for default initialization.
//Step 2:  To install necessary dependencies for our application, us the following command:
npm install express

//This will create the projet structure with node_modules, package.json &package-lockjson files.
//Step3:Now we will create a app.js file and write the express code in it.

//Step4: To run the application: Now as we have created a server now we can successfully start running it to see that if itâ€™s working, write this command in the terminal to start the express server. 

node app.js

Now with all of this, we have created and run the server successfully.
//Step 5: Now we will set all the routes for our application. 
//Step6:  Save this code, restart the server, and open the localhost on the given port.
