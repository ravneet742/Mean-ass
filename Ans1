//Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints.
//Routing with Express in Node: Express.js has an “app” object corresponding to HTTP. We define the routes by using the methods of this “app” object. This app object specifies a callback function, which is called when a request is received. We have different methods in app object for a different type of request.

//For GET request:
var express = require('express')
var app = express()

app.get('/', function(req, res) { //we use this function for getting the request
    res.send('Hello World')
})

//For POST request:
var express = require('express')
var app = express()

app.post('/', function(req, res) { //we use this function for posting the request
    res.send('Hello World')
})

//For handling all HTTP methods (i.e. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.):
var express = require('express')
var app = express()

app.all('/', function(req, res) { //we use this function for handling the HTTP requests
    console.log('Hello World')
    next()   //  It Pass the control to the next handler,next() is used to hand off the control to the next callback. 
})

//Sometimes we use app.use() to specify the middleware function as the callback.
//To perform the routing with the Express.js, we have only to load the express and then use the app object to handle the callbacks according to the requirement.
